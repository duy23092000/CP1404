# CP1404 2019 SP1 Assignment 1 - Travel Tracker
Assignment 1 for CP1404/CP1804, IT@JCU

By: **Nguyen Quang Duy**  

This repo contains starter files including a Python file and two CSV files.  
(`temp.csv` is to copy from in case you delete the contents of `places.csv` and want the original data back).  
**Edit this README file**, replacing this paragraph with your own assignment name and details.  
At the end of the project, complete the very brief project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the `answer...` parts).  
Note: If you use the free WakaTime service on your own machine, you can track exactly how long you spent in code (over one week).

1. How long did the entire assignment 1 project take you?
> This is more difficult than the programming 1 assignment so it took me more than 2 weeks to complete and finish it.

2. What do you plan to do  differently in your development process for assignment 2?
> I think i will try to simplify mine cause sometimes i want it to be more beautiful so that it comes to be more complex.
